Assignment 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Item

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with communicating with stakeholders, asking questions, and identifying the problems they are trying to solve. Once those needs are understood, they can be translated into requirements and built into the program in a way that directly addresses user expectations. Creating user stories helps with this process because they describe requirements from the end user’s point of view. By framing needs as “As a (user), I want (feature), so that (benefit),” user stories keep the focus on value, rather than just features.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by breaking down larger problems into smaller, manageable tasks that can be solved incrementally. This makes it easier to test and adapt as development progresses. Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives provide structure. I will incorporate practices like continuous integration, incremental delivery, and feedback into my future work. These processes reduce risk, keep the team aligned, and ensure that the final product meets users' needs.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means going beyond technical contributions to support the success of the entire team. It involves clear communication, a collaborative mindset, and enabling others to depend on you. A good team member respects diverse perspectives, stays accountable to shared goals, and provides feedback. Ultimately, teamwork is about creating an environment where everyone can thrive and contribute to delivering value.
